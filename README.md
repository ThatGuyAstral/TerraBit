# TerraBit

## What is Terrabit?

It is an Open-Source JSON and CSV Editor.

### wth are CSVs and JSONs?

They are files with values stored for miscellaneous purposes

Here's an example of Python using a .json file to display values:

JSON:

```json
{
    "test": "Hi this is a long piece of string for python to load hehe"
}
```

Python File:

```python
import json

filename = Values.json

with open(filename, 'r') as json_file:
    data = json.load(json_file)

test = data["test"]
print("Value:", test)
```

## Why did you make this?

Just for fun and also because I couldn't think of anything else

## Where's the Source Code?

Source Code can be found in the 'TBSC' folder above. (Requires installation of Python, pip and Kivy.)

If bugs are reported, then yes.

Also if I feel like it.
